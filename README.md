# Library

This is a simple, interactive book library application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Users can add books to a personal library, toggle their read status, and remove books from the list. The application features a responsive grid layout for book cards and a modal form for adding new entries.

## Features

* **Add New Books**: Fill in a form to add a book with title, author, page count, and read status.
* **Toggle Read Status**: Switch between "Read" and "Not Read" directly from each book card.
* **Remove Books**: Easily delete books from the library.
* **Responsive Layout**: Book cards are displayed in a responsive grid that adjusts to screen size.
* **Modal Overlay**: When the form is active, a dark overlay dims the background to focus the user on the form.

## Tech Stack

* **HTML**: Provides the structure of the library page and form.
* **CSS**:

  * Custom styles for layout and UI elements.
  * Flexbox and Grid for layout.
  * Transitions and hover effects for buttons.
  * Modal and overlay styling.
